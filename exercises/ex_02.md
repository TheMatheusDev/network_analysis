# Practice:

1. Run the following tutorials on Pyvis and Streamlit:

- https://pyvis.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorial.html 
- https://towardsdatascience.com/making-network-graphs-interactive-with-python-and-pyvis-b754c22c270 
- https://github.com/napoles-uach/streamlit_network/  
- https://github.com/napoles-uach/streamlit_network/blob/main/pyvis_sample.ipynb  
- https://towardsdatascience.com/building-interactive-network-graphs-using-pyvis-5b8e6e25cf64 

2. From a dataset of your choice, create a notebook containing an exploratory analysis flow, containing the main network analysis concepts seen so far to be integrated into Streamlit with Pyvis:
- Adjacency matrix.
- Diameter and periphery of the network.
- Empirical degree distribution histogram.
- Local clustering coefficient for chosen nodes.
- Global clustering coefficient.
- Strongly Connected Components
- Weakly Connected Components.
- Degree centrality.
- Closeness centrality.
- Betweenness centrality.
- Eigenvector centrality.
